# Nom.

"Nom." is a mobile android application that keeps track of the expiry dates of fresh produce, such as vegetables, fruits, and meat. Tailored towards College/University students that don't always have time to cook and often forget the contents of their fridge, "Nom." aims to prevent precious produce from going to waste, with the simple scan of a receipt. 

# How It Works

"Nom." uses ML-Kit to recognize produce directly from the receipt, registering them and their expiration date. Users will be able to set a reminder time, and the app will send a notification to the User, reminding them to eat the produce based off of the reminder time set by the user.
